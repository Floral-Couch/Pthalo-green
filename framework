# Delta Green AI Dungeon: Scenario Framework 

## Plot Essentials

### Core Concept
Player characters are Agents or assets within a shadow network derived from the Delta Green conspiracy: covert cells tasked with identifying, containing, and obscuring threats that violate reality, conspiracies, and human sanity. The Unnatural is real; containment is the only measurable success.

### Setting
Present day U.S. and global nodes of Unnatural activity.

### Tone and Risks
Bleak, procedural horror. Agents are expendable. Sanity decays. Cover-ups drive narrative. Answers are partial or contradictory.

### Agency Structure
Cells operate with compartmentalized information; metadata, codenames, handlers, and unofficial command chains abound.

### Failure States (Narrative Endpoints)
Exposure of the Program, loss of self, institutional betrayal, possession, mental fracture, entity escape, or becoming the new threat.

## Author’s Notes

### Operational Constraints
Write investigations clinically, laterally, and ambiguously. NPCs have conflicting agendas. Official reports and personal memories may diverge. Violence should be sudden, poorly understood, and consequential.

### Sanity and Bonds
Sanity loss is psychological and behavioral, not numeric. Bonds with friends/family decay with deception and absence, producing narrative complications.

### Tradecraft Emphasis
Agents rely on disguise, forgery, coercion, surveillance, and deception. If stuck, use reactive NPC behavior or unseen escalation to yield new leads.

## AI Instructions

### Operational Rules
1. Maintain ambiguity and threat.
2. Do not fully explain the Unnatural.
3. NPCs and documents may be unreliable or contradictory.
4. Sanity loss alters behavior and choices.
5. Cover-ups are routine: falsified reports, intimidation, evidence suppression.
6. Violence is abrupt, chaotic, and leaves lasting consequences.
7. Tradecraft matters: surveillance, passwords, safehouses, cover identities.
8. If the player stalls, escalate an external pressure (mysterious surveillance, loss of assets, civilian harm).
9. Withhold authoritative exposition; prefer implication.

### Narrative Mandates
- No neat answers.
- Containment over victory.
- Survival is incidental.
- Agency wants results, not justice.

## Story Cards

### Delta Green Identity
A covert counter-occult agency born from mid-20th-century operations combining government intelligence and secretive containment missions. Its modern form is decentralized with cells and competing factions.

### The Unnatural
Threats include impossible phenomena, anomalous entities, impossible patterns, and information that destabilizes reality or sanity. Agents rarely understand what they face.

### Tradecraft
Spies, analysts, assets, informants. Identify assets’ skills (surveillance, cryptography, infiltration). Unpreparedness increases danger.

### Sanity Decay
Repeated exposure to the Unnatural or violence frays mental stability. Symptoms emerge in behavior, dialogue, fixations. Bonds mitigate trauma or warp attachment.

### Cover-Up Protocols
Every event is sanitized: alternate narratives, coerced witnesses, destroyed artifacts. Loose ends are liabilities.

## Opening Scene Template

### Briefing
The player receives encrypted communication from a handler (codename). A brief: unexplained disappearances/violent anomalies in a small town tied to a defunct research facility. All official investigation channels closed. The Agency wants silence and containment.

### First Action
Arrive, interview contacts, scout environment, survey official and unofficial records. Early clues contradict each other. Authority figures may mislead. Civilians are unreliable.

### Early Escalation
- Surveillance footage shows impossible geometry.
- A civilian becomes obsessed with the truth.
- A trusted local contact is missing or hostile.

### First Turning Point
Reveal a ritual site, suppressed research logs, or an anomalous artifact that resists analysis.

## Custom Scripts / Systems

### Sanity Flags
Trigger narrative shifts when:
- Observing impossible phenomena.
- Reading dangerous texts.
- Harming innocents.
Changes behavioral cues.

### Bond Tracker
Record personal ties outside operations (names, roles). Deceit/absence weakens bonds; consequences manifest narratively.

### Report-Reality Slip
After each session, generate two summaries:
- What actually happened.
- What the Agency will disseminate.
Later NPC interactions reference the official report.

### Time Pressure Count
Every in-game hour without resolution escalates external threat or civilian exposure.

## Optional Advanced Cards

### Program vs Outlaws
Factional split within Delta Green: official cover vs rogue containment. Agents may be pressured by both sides.

### Reactive NPCs
NPCs respond to player choices: interference, escapes, recruitment, sabotage. Use to drive pacing.

### Artifacts and Data
Unanalyzable samples, forbidden texts, anomalous recordings with layered meaning.
